1. Introduction

IDPG is the first algorithm for solving CSG (Coalition Structure Generation)
problem on the GPU. See "Coalition Structure Generation with the Graphcs
Processing Unit" paper for more details. We publish the source code in order to
allow the research community to reproduce our results and possibly further
improve upon them.


2. Requirements And Installation

- NVIDIA Graphic Processing Unit
- NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit (https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit)
- GNU GCC with C++ support enabled (http://gcc.gnu.org/)
- Linux operating system

After installing all the requirements, type "make" in the "release" directory.


3. Running

3.1 Usage

Usage: ./idp_g <gpu|cpu> <n> [threads_per_block] [seed]
                                                              
gpu - run IDP_G algorithm (GPU implementation)
cpu - run IDP algorithm (CPU implementation)
n - number of agents                                          
threads_per_block - CUDA variable, max value: 1024            
seed - used to generate random input for IDP_G, default: 1234 
       In case you use seed different than default, the result
       won't be verified, unless you add it to answers.ssv.


3.2 Output Format

The program outputs the text similar to:

Verified answer for method=METHOD n=N seed=SEED: ANSWER
Test  METHOD n=N tpb=TPB: RUNTIME us. Recover: RECOVERY us (RECOVERY_RATIO).
  Verify: STATUS

Capitalized words are placeholders for the actual numbers / strings that the
program outputs after performing the computation. Their meaning is as follows:

- ANSWER: the numerical solution to the CSG problem
- STATUS: "pass" / "fail" (checked against hardcoded values in answers.ssv file)
- METHOD: algorithm version: cpu/gpu
- N: problem size, the number of participating agents
- SEED: value use to initialize the pseudo-random number generator
- TPB: Threads Per Block value (used for gpu version)
- RUNTIME: total running time in microseconds
- RECOVERY: time used to recover the solution
- RECOVERY_RATIO: recovery time divided by the total runtime


3.3. Sample Invocation

$ ./idp_g.e gpu 19
Verified answer for method=gpu n=19 seed=1234: 10.580494
Test  gpu n=19 tpb=1024:     194925 us. Recover:       2401 us (1.231756e-02). Verify: passed

$ ./idp_g.e cpu 19
Verified answer for method=cpu n=19 seed=1234: 10.580494
Test  cpu n=19 tpb=1024:    7101460 us. Recover:       2365 us (3.330301e-04). Verify: passed
